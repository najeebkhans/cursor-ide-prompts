## üìò Introduction

This repository provides a **comprehensive reference of powerful prompts** designed to fully utilize Cursor IDE‚Äôs AI capabilities. The guide is structured from **Basic**, **Intermediate**, to **Power User Prompts**, including **Chain-of-Thought reasoning**, multi-step debugging, multi-layer analysis, and performance tuning. Use this as your go-to **Cursor IDE Prompting Cheat Sheet** to push the limits of what Cursor can achieve.

  `Add JSDoc comments to this function.`

* **Explain Errors:**
  `Explain this error and suggest how to fix it.`

* **Suggest Clean Code Improvements:**
  `Suggest improvements to make this function follow clean code practices.`

* **File-Level Summary:**
  `Summarize this file and explain its purpose.`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Intermediate Prompts

* **Chain of Thought Debugging:**
  `Use chain-of-thought reasoning to debug the following. Explain step-by-step what could be going wrong and why, covering code logic, runtime errors, and dependency issues.`
  `<<< Insert code or error here >>>`

* **Multi-Layer Root Cause Analysis:**
  `Analyze the following issue on 3 levels: 1) Immediate syntax/logic errors, 2) Architectural flaws, 3) Potential edge case failures. Provide fixes for each layer.`
  `<<< Insert code or issue here >>>`

* **Refactor with Performance Focus:**
  `Refactor this code to aggressively optimize for performance. Minimize memory use, reduce computations, and suggest faster data structures.`

* **Generate Edge Case Unit Tests:**
  `Identify all edge cases that could break this function and write additional unit tests to cover them.`

* **API Integration Validation:**
  `Evaluate this API integration for failure points: network errors, rate limits, bad responses, and missing error handling. Suggest robust retry and fallback mechanisms.`

* **Dependency Chain Mapping:**
  `Map the full dependency chain for this component and identify where failures could cascade. Suggest isolation techniques for testing.`

* **Multi-Option Refactor with Trade-offs:**
  `Provide 3 alternative ways to refactor this function: one optimized for speed, one for memory efficiency, and one for code clarity. Recommend the best with reasoning.`

* **Recursive vs Iterative Comparison:**
  `Compare recursive vs iterative versions of this function. Discuss performance trade-offs, stack overflow risks, and the best production choice.`

* **Cross-Language Limitation Check:**
  `Convert this [language] code to [target language]. List potential behavioral changes and limitations that may appear in the converted version.`

* **Best Practices Audit:**
  `Review this file against the latest best practices for [React/Node/Next.js/etc.] and suggest updates for deprecated or outdated patterns.`

## üöÄ Power User Prompts (Push Cursor to the Limit)

* **Advanced Chain of Thought Debugging (Deep Dive):**
  `Use chain-of-thought reasoning to deeply debug the following. Go step-by-step through code logic, runtime possibilities, API dependencies, and potential misconfigurations. Provide a detailed root cause analysis and practical fixes.`
  `<<< Insert full function, module, or error trace here >>>`

* **Failure Simulation Scenarios:**
  `Simulate how this function would behave under extreme conditions: max input size, API downtime, database lock, unexpected payloads. Recommend fail-safe adjustments, circuit breaker patterns, and graceful degradation strategies.`

* **Hot Path Performance Tuning:**
  `This function is a hot path. Refactor it for extreme execution speed, even if readability is slightly reduced. Use memory-efficient loops, inline critical logic, and minimize re-renders or heavy computations.`

* **Codebase-Wide Impact Check:**
  `If this function changes, which other files or components could break? Map the ripple effect across the project and list all dependent modules.`

* **Dependency Failure Points:**
  `Map all dependencies for this component and identify where failures could occur: API layers, database connections, external libraries, or state management. Suggest robust isolation or mocking techniques.`

* **Aggressive Performance Refactor:**
  `Refactor this function to aggressively optimize it for maximum speed and minimum memory consumption. Replace inefficient patterns, collapse function calls, and recommend parallelization if possible.`

* **Multi-Option Refactor Strategy (With Metrics):**
  `Provide 3 alternative refactoring strategies: one maximizing speed, one minimizing memory, and one maximizing code clarity. Discuss the trade-offs, estimate time complexity, and recommend the best solution.`

* **Simulate API Integration Failure:**
  `Simulate API failure scenarios for this integration: rate limiting, network timeouts, malformed responses. Propose retry mechanisms, exponential backoff, and fallback procedures.`

* **Critical Error Explainer with Chain of Thought:**
  `Use chain-of-thought reasoning to explain this critical error. Walk through all possible failure points: input validation, state management, API calls, database layers, and concurrency issues.`
  `<<< Insert critical error log or code snippet here >>>`

* **Full Failure Simulation and Edge-Case Attack:**
  `List extreme test cases, failure scenarios, edge-case payloads, and simulate abnormal user behavior for this feature. Recommend hardening techniques, validation layers, and input sanitization.`

* **System-Level Impact Mapping:**
  `If this component fails, what will be the cascading impact on the entire system? Identify all affected modules, user-facing elements, and suggest ways to contain the failure.`

## üí° Pro Tips for Power Prompting

* Always **highlight the exact code block** to provide Cursor with the most accurate context.
* Use **chain-of-thought prompts to force step-by-step AI reasoning.**
* Demand **multi-perspective answers** (speed, memory, readability trade-offs) to get well-rounded solutions.
* Always specify your **framework, language, testing library, or API environment** for precise results.
* Break complex tasks into **multi-step prompts**: generate structure ‚Üí write logic ‚Üí add error handling ‚Üí write tests.
* Push Cursor to **simulate failures, edge cases, and worst-case scenarios** to fully bulletproof your code.
